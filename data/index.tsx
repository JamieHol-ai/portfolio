          <p>
            For this project I designed and built an affordable 3D room scanner with a 180-degree field of view, achieving accurate space representation through efficient data collection and visualisation.
            I used an Arduino with a pan/tilt unit and infrared sensor for data collection, and a computer for processing and display.

          <p>
            Integrated a new Optical Speed Sensor with a self-driving race car to enhance speed measurement accuracy and improve positioning by supplementing wheel odometry.
            This involved utilising CAN protocols for communication between the sensor and race car systems, developing templates for seamless integration.
            To do this I had to collaborate with older peers, enhancing communication and problem-solving skills, and learning to convey technical information effectively.
